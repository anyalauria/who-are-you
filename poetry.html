      <p id="poem1"> I was sitting on a hill <br>The sky was green<br>The grass was blue 
        <br>The wind so still 
        <br>I said to myself 
        <br>Until
        <br>
        <br>Until I know
        <br>What life is about 
        <br>I’ll stay right here
        <br>Until it all becomes clear
        <br>Why the sour tarts tart
        <br>Why the frown horns horn 
        <br>Why the iggle biggle wiggles 
        <br>Why is meaning so fickle? 
        <br>
        <br>so I won’t move an inch 
        <br>I won’t leave this place 
        <br>I’ll watch the world spin around 
        <br> And when it puts me in a daze 
        <br>And my mind is completely crazed 
        <br>I’ll shout and I’ll scream that It all makes sense
        <br>Why was I so tense? </p>
